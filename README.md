# Capstone Project #1
## Overview
This project focuses on (using the word loosely to refer to unsolicited calls) robocalls, a constant nuisance of a problem Americans face daily. While the federal government is constantly fighting against them, the robocalls remain a constant problem. This project seeks to find trends and forecast the number of robocalls we can expect.
